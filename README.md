# Flight Booker

This is a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) as part of their Ruby on Rails curriculum. The goal of this project is to provide a deep dive into the Rails framework, focusing on some of the main features of Rails including:

- **Devise**: This project uses Devise for user authentication. It allows users to sign up, log in, and log out.

- **Model Architecture and Creation**: The project demonstrates how to design and create models in Rails. It includes models for flights, users, and bookings.

- **Complex Associations**: The project involves setting up complex associations between models. For example, a user can have multiple bookings, and a booking can have multiple passengers.

- **Database Seeding**: The project includes a seeds file for populating the database with sample data for development and testing purposes.
